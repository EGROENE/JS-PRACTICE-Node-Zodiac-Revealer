# Zodiac-Revealer
This is a practice project I used to practice using Node and the npm package 'readline-sync' and is one of the first such projects I worked on. The program runs in the terminal and the user can input things like their name, a confirmation that they're ready to find out what their Zodiac sign is, and select the date range where their birthday falls. The user is then informed of what their sign is. It's a very basic project, I know, but it is one of the first times I successfully used Node, so I think it's still pretty cool. The only difference between the 'main.js' & the 'main2.js' files is the logic I used; in 'main.js', I used if/else if statements and in 'main2.js', I used the Switch Method. All in all, it took only 69 lines of code ;)
